            I am Andre, someone that likes problem-solving, logical reasoning, artistic creation
            and investigating details of his surroundings.<br><br>
            Throughout life, I have always felt fascinated by the amazing systems and mechanics humanity
            has created, and I seek to explore more on how it came to life and go in-depth on how
            it works, which fuels my passion for science.<br><br>
            As I grew, so does my curiosity, which I channeled into investigations and interactions,
            broadening my horizons not just in the field of science, but also humanities and art,
            tilling my pathway towards understanding the world as a whole.

          <p class="content-desc">
            I have made some macros the past few years, which assists in gaming. The codes I made are aimed to
            support fast clicking, quick key combinations that are otherwise hard to do and sending messages
            automatically. From these experiences, I learnt that internet delays is a major limitation to these macros,
            which might mess up precise timings, especially when it is used under unstable connections. Looking
            into the future, I would like to learn more on how server and clients exchange packets, which may
            help me in accounting these delays into the code.<br><br>
